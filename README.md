Python code to demo Facenet for EDQ Tech Tarik

The facenet and MTCNN implementation was copied from [David Sandberg's facenet repo](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).
So credit goes to him for the actual implementation.

This repository just adds the `demo.py`

# Compatibility
- Python3.7+
- Tensorflow v1
- OpenCV

# To run
```python demo.py```
